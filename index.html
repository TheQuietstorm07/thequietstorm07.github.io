	<p>Building credit can be tough, but there are some ways to build good credit on your own or with the help from others. Opening a credit card for a retail store is an easy way to build credit if you pay off the bill as soon as possible. These cards hold high interest rates so paying the balance off will keep you from accruing extra charges on the account. You can achieve this by only purchasing items with the credit card that you would be able to buy at that time with the money you have in your bank account. Doing this at least once a month will guarantee that your credit score will grow. A way to build good credit with the help from others is asking to be an authorized user on the account. As long as your name is on the account you will benefit, as long as the account is in good standing with the creditor.
